# Chrome/Google Sheets Crash Fix Summary

## Problem
After rebuilding and reloading the extension, Chrome would crash and Google Sheets would freeze. This was happening almost every time.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the visual snapshot capture system for spreadsheets:

1. **When recording started on Google Sheets**, the `RecordingManager.start()` method would call `VisualSnapshotService.captureFullPage()`
2. **This method automatically zoomed out to 33%** to capture more columns in the spreadsheet
3. **The zoom manipulation was too aggressive** and would trigger Google Sheets to re-render, causing:
   - Browser tab freezing
   - Chrome crashes
   - Unresponsive UI

The specific flow was:
```
RecordingManager.start() 
  → captureFullPage() 
    → getZoomLevel() 
    → setZoomLevel(0.33) 
    → wait 600ms 
    → capture screenshot 
    → setZoomLevel(originalZoom)
```

This was happening **immediately when recording started**, and if the extension was reloaded multiple times, it would trigger repeated zoom operations that overwhelmed Google Sheets.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Concurrent Operation Guard (`visual-snapshot.ts`)
```typescript
// Prevent concurrent zoom operations
private static isZoomOperationInProgress: boolean = false;
```

- Added a flag to prevent multiple zoom operations from running simultaneously
- If a zoom operation is already in progress, the capture is skipped to prevent crashes

### 2. Increased Wait Times (`visual-snapshot.ts`)
- Increased repaint wait from **600ms → 800ms** after zoom
- Increased restoration wait from **100ms → 150ms** after restoring zoom
- This gives Google Sheets more time to stabilize after zoom changes

### 3. Added Delayed Execution (`recording-manager.ts`)
- Added **800ms delay** before starting the capture on page scroll
- Added **1000ms delay** before starting the capture when scroll is already at (0,0)
- This prevents the capture from running immediately when the extension loads

### 4. Added Timeout Protection (`recording-manager.ts`)
```typescript
Promise.race([
  VisualSnapshotService.captureFullPage(0.8),
  new Promise<null>((resolve) => setTimeout(() => {
    console.warn('📸 GhostWriter: captureFullPage timed out after 5s');
    resolve(null);
  }, 5000))
])
```

- Added 5-second timeout to prevent the capture from hanging indefinitely
- If capture takes longer than 5 seconds, it gracefully fails instead of crashing

### 5. Improved Error Recovery (`visual-snapshot.ts`)
- Added try-catch blocks around zoom operations
- Added finally block to ensure the flag is always reset
- Better handling of zoom operation failures

## Testing Instructions

1. **Reload the extension** in Chrome:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Click the reload icon on the Autoflow extension
   
2. **Navigate to Google Sheets**:
   - Open any Google Sheet
   - Wait a few seconds for the extension to initialize
   
3. **Start recording**:
   - Open the extension side panel
   - Click "Start Recording"
   - The capture should now happen smoothly without freezing

4. **Watch for these improvements**:
   - No sudden zoom changes that freeze the sheet
   - Console logs showing delayed capture execution
   - Recording starts normally without crashes

## Expected Behavior Now

- ✅ Extension loads without immediately triggering zoom operations
- ✅ When recording starts, there's a deliberate delay before capturing
- ✅ Only one zoom operation can run at a time
- ✅ If capture takes too long, it times out gracefully
- ✅ Google Sheets should remain responsive throughout

## If Issues Persist

If you still experience crashes:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for any error messages starting with `📸 GhostWriter:`
2. **Try disabling spreadsheet zoom**: Edit `visual-snapshot.ts` line 408 and comment out the zoom operation entirely
3. **Increase delays further**: Try increasing the delays in `recording-manager.ts` from 800ms/1000ms to 1500ms/2000ms
4. **Clear Cache**: Sometimes Chrome's cache can cause issues - try clearing it

## Files Modified

1. `src/content/visual-snapshot.ts`
   - Added concurrent operation guard
   - Increased wait times
   - Improved error handling

2. `src/content/recording-manager.ts`
   - Added delayed execution
   - Added timeout protection
   - Better error recovery

## Technical Notes

The zoom-to-33% feature is specifically designed for spreadsheets to capture more column headers in a single screenshot. This helps the AI understand the full context when analyzing workflows. However, the aggressive zoom manipulation was causing stability issues. The fixes maintain this functionality while making it much safer and more stable.
